Linear models assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable and other independent variables. Decision trees, however, can capture more complex relationships by dividing the data into subsets based on an attribute value, then recursively repeating this process on these subsets. This allows decision trees to model non-linear relationships and interactions between variables that a linear model might miss"
