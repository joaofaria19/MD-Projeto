It does so using a recursive helper function `validate`.\n\nThe `validate` function takes three arguments:\n\n- `node`: The current node being evaluated.\n- `min_val`: The minimum value allowed for nodes in the left subtree of the current node.\n- `max_val`: The maximum value allowed for nodes in the right subtree of the current node.\n\nThe `validate` function recursively checks the following conditions:\n\n- If the current node is null, it returns True, indicating that the subtree is valid.\n- If the current node's value is less than or equal to the `min_val` or greater than or equal to the `max_val`, it returns False, indicating that the subtree is not a binary search tree.\n- Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the left and right subtrees, updating the `min_val` and `max_val` accordingly, to ensure that the values in each subtree maintain the binary search tree property.\n\nThe `is_binary_search_tree` function simply calls the `validate` function on the root of the tree, with `min_val` set to negative infinity and `max_val` set to positive infinity. This ensures that the entire tree is checked against the binary search tree property.\n"

    "Prompt": "Calculate the amount of money in a bank account with an initial $100 deposit and an interest rate of 6%, compounded annually",
    "Completion": "## Calculating Bank Account Growth with Compound Interest\n\nHere's how to calculate the amount of money in a bank account with an initial $100 deposit and an interest rate of 6%, compounded annually:\n\n**Formula:**\n\n`Future Value (FV) = Principal (P) x (1 + Interest Rate (R))^Time (T)`\n\n**Values:**\n\n* **Principal (P):** $100\n* **Interest Rate (R):** 6% (or 0.06 as a decimal)\n* **Time (T):** Number of years\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's say you want to calculate the future value after 5 years:\n\n* **FV = $100 x (1 + 0.06)^5**\n* **FV = $100 x 1.338225587**\n* **FV = $133.82 (approximately)**\n\nTherefore, after 5 years with an annual interest rate of 6%, the $100 deposit would grow to approximately $133.82.\n\n**Here's a table showing the growth over different timeframes:**\n\n| Year | Future Value |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | $106.00 |\n| 2 | $112.36 |\n| 3 | $119.10 |\n| 4 | $126.25 |\n| 5 | $133.82 |\n| 10 | $179.08 |\n| 20 | $320.71 |\n| 30 | $574.35 |\n\nAs you can see, the longer the money stays in the account, the more it will grow due to the compounding interest.\n\n**Additional factors to consider:**\n\n* **Frequency of compounding:** If the interest is compounded more frequently than annually (e.g., monthly, quarterly), the future value will be slightly higher.\n* **Additional deposits:** If you make additional deposits to the account, the future value will increase even further.\n* **Withdrawal:** If you withdraw money from the account, the future value will be lower.\n\nYou can use online compound interest calculators to explore different scenarios and see how much your money will grow over time.\n"

    "Prompt": "Describe the principle of the Law of Supply.",
    "Completion": "## The Principle of Supply: A Foundation of Economics \n\n**The Law of Supply states that the higher the price of a good or service, the greater the quantity of that good or service that producers are willing to supply.** \n\nThis principle assumes a positive correlation between price and quantity supplied, meaning as the price increases, producers will be incentivized to produce and sell more units of that good or service.\n\n**Factors Influencing Supply:**\n\n- **Production Costs:** When the cost of producing a good or service rises, the quantity supplied decreases. Conversely, lower production costs encourage increased supply.\n- **Technology:** Advancements in technology that make production more efficient or less expensive can lead to an increase in supply. \n- **Government Regulations:** Regulations that restrict or impose costs on producers, such as taxes or licensing requirements, can decrease the quantity supplied.\n- **Price of Related Goods:** If the prices of complementary goods increase, the supply of the original good may also increase. \n- **Natural Disasters and Other External Factors**: Events like floods, droughts, or wars can disrupt production and lead to a reduction in supply.\n- **Number of Sellers**: An increase in the number of producers offering the same product can increase the overall supply of that good in the market. \n\n**Understanding Supply and Demand:**\n\nThe Law of Supply works in tandem with the Law of Demand to determine the equilibrium price and quantity in a market. \n\n- The Law of Demand states that the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded by consumers.\n\n- The interaction between supply and demand creates an intersection point, known as the market equilibrium. At this point, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, resulting in a stable market price.\n\n**Significance of Supply:** \n\n- Supply plays a crucial role in determining market prices. Shifts in supply, either upwards or downwards, can lead to price fluctuations. \n- Understanding supply is essential for producers, businesses, and individuals to make informed choices about pricing, resource allocation,  and market behavior.\n"
