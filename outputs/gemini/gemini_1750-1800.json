Unlike the vibrant chorus that usually erupted at dawn, there was an unsettling stillness in the air today. This was the bird's first sunrise without its companion, a vibrant blue jay who had shared the willow tree and its secrets for years.\n\nThe silence was deafening. The bird hopped restlessly on its perch, its feathers ruffled, its heart heavy. It sang a lonely melody, a mournful tune that echoed through the empty branches, a plea for its friend to return. The wind whispered in response, rustling the leaves in a sympathetic sigh.\n\nThe bird's memories of its friend flooded its mind. They had shared countless sunrises and sunsets, their feathers brushing against each other in the warm summer breeze, their songs mingling in joyful harmony. They had explored the forest together, discovering hidden nooks and secret streams, sharing stories and laughter along the way.\n\nBut that was before the storm. The ferocious wind and blinding rain had separated them, leaving the bird stranded and alone. It had searched for its companion tirelessly, calling out in the pouring rain, but its voice was lost in the deafening roar of the elements. \n\nNow, with the sun starting to peek through the mist, casting golden rays across the land, the bird knew it couldn't stay in the willow tree forever. It had to be strong, to find the courage to venture out and face the unknown. With a heavy heart, it spread its wings and took flight.\n\nThe world outside the willow tree seemed vast and unfamiliar. The bird flew cautiously, searching for any sign of its friend. It encountered other birds, some welcoming, others indifferent. But none could replace the void left by its lost companion.\n\nDays turned into weeks, weeks into months. The bird continued its search, its hope slowly fading. But just when the loneliness threatened to engulf it entirely, a familiar melody drifted through the air. It was the song of its friend!\n\nWith renewed energy, the bird soared towards the sound, its heart pounding with anticipation. And there, perched on a flowering branch, was its companion, just as vibrant as ever. \n\nA wave of joy washed over the bird as it reunited with its friend. They chirped excitedly, sharing stories of their individual journeys, their voices weaving a melody of love and friendship that echoed through the forest. \n\nThey had changed, their feathers slightly ruffled, their songs a tad less perfect, but their bond remained unbreakable. The lonely bird had found its way back to its companion, proving that even in the face of despair, hope and friendship can conquer all."

It creates a 2D matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common substring ending at the `i`th character of `str1` and the `j`th character of `str2`.\n\nThe function iterates over the matrix, filling in the values of `dp[i][j]` based on the following logic:\n\n* If the characters at `str1[i-1]` and `str2[j-1]` are the same, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to the value at `dp[i-1][j-1]` plus 1. This means that the common substring is extended by one character.\n* If the characters are different, then `dp[i][j]` is set to 0, indicating that the common substring ends at the previous character.\n\nAfter filling in the matrix, the function finds the maximum value in `dp` and returns the substring corresponding to that value.\n\n## Note\n\nThis function finds the longest contiguous substring that is common to both strings. If you want to find all common substrings, regardless of their length or continuity, you can modify the function to keep track of multiple potential common substrings and return them all.\n"

My senses heightened, attuned to every subtle change in the environment. The air grew steadily cooler and thicker, carrying a faint earthy smell mixed with a hint of something ancient and unknown.\n\nThe walls began to close in as I squeezed through narrow passages, my body forced to contort and adapt to the shifting contours of the cave.

The sight was both awe-inspiring and humbling, reminding me of the incredible power and artistry of nature.\n\nI explored the cavern further, discovering hidden chambers and hidden waterfalls that cascaded into pools of crystal-clear water. With each twist and turn, the cave revealed its secrets, unveiling a world both beautiful and perilous that had remained hidden from the outside world for countless years.\n\nAs I finally emerged from the cave, blinking in the bright sunlight, the world outside felt strangely familiar yet utterly transformed.

    "Completion": "## Five Things to Avoid for Academic Success:\n\n1. Procrastination: Putting off tasks until the last minute can lead to stress, anxiety, and rushed work that is of lower quality. Plan ahead, break down large assignments into smaller steps, and start working on them early to avoid the last-minute crunch.\n\n2. Inadequate Preparation: Skipping classes, not reading assigned materials, and neglecting to do homework can put you at a significant disadvantage. Come to class prepared, actively participate, and dedicate sufficient time to studying and completing assignments.\n\n3. Lack of Focus: Distractions like social media, phone notifications, and irrelevant conversations can significantly impact your concentration and productivity. Choose a quiet study environment, use tools like noise-canceling headphones, and set aside dedicated time for focused work.\n\n4. Poor Time Management: Juggling multiple commitments without proper planning can lead to missed deadlines, incomplete assignments, and unnecessary stress. Utilize a planner or calendar, set realistic deadlines, and prioritize tasks to effectively manage your time.\n\n5. Negative Self-Talk: Doubting your abilities, engaging in negative self-talk, and comparing yourself to others can significantly hinder your performance. Focus on your strengths, acknowledge your progress, and celebrate your achievements to maintain a positive and motivated mindset.\n\nRemember, academic success is a journey, not a destination. It requires consistent effort, effective strategies, and a positive attitude. By avoiding these common pitfalls, you can enhance your focus, improve your productivity, and achieve your academic goals."
