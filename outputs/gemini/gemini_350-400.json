It is a special case of motion where an object experiences constant acceleration due to gravity in the vertical direction while moving with constant horizontal velocity.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n\n* **Neglecting air resistance:** Projectile motion assumes no air resistance or drag for simplicity.\n* **Constant acceleration:** The object experiences constant acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2) in the downward direction.\n* **Independence of horizontal and vertical motion:** The horizontal and vertical components of motion are independent of each other.\n* **Parabolic trajectory:** The path of the projectile forms a parabola, determined by the initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration.\n\n**Equations of Motion:**\n\nThe equations of motion for projectile motion describe the object's position and velocity at any point in time.\n\n* **Horizontal motion:**\n    * x = v\u2080\u2093 * t (horizontal displacement)\n    * v\u2093 = v\u2080\u2093 (constant horizontal velocity)\n* **Vertical motion:**\n    * y = v\u2080\u1d67 * t - (1/2) * g * t\u00b2 (vertical displacement)\n    * v\u1d67 = v\u2080\u1d67 - g * t (vertical velocity)\n\nwhere:\n\n* x and y are the horizontal and vertical positions, respectively\n* v\u2080\u2093 and v\u2080\u1d67 are the initial horizontal and vertical velocities, respectively\n* g is the acceleration due to gravity\n* t is the time\n\n**Important Points:**\n\n* The time it takes for the projectile to reach its maximum height is equal to the time it takes to fall back to the same height.\n* The range of the projectile, or the horizontal distance traveled, depends on the initial launch velocity and angle.\n* The maximum height of the projectile depends on the initial vertical velocity and the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n**Applications:**\n\nProjectile motion has numerous real-world applications, including:\n\n* Ballistics: calculating the trajectory of bullets, rockets, and missiles\n* Sports: analyzing the motion of balls in sports like basketball, baseball, and football\n* Engineering: designing bridges, roller coasters, and other structures that involve projectile motion\n\n**Understanding projectile motion provides insights into the behavior of objects under the influence of gravity and plays a crucial role in various scientific and engineering fields.**"

The outer loop iterates from 0 to `length(arr) - 1`, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to `length(arr) - i - 2`.\n* Inside the inner loop, the elements `arr[j]` and `arr[j + 1]` are compared. If the first element is greater than the second, they are swapped using the `swap` function.\n* The `swap` function takes two elements `x` and `y` as input and exchanges their values.\n* The outer loop continues iterating until no more swaps are made, indicating that the array is sorted.\n* Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\n## Key points:\n\n* Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them to the correct ordering.\n* The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2), making it inefficient for large datasets.\n* However, its simplicity makes it a good starting point for understanding sorting algorithms and implementing them in code.\n\n## Note:\n\nThis is just one example of a pseudocode for bubble sort. There are other ways to implement this algorithm in pseudocode, and the specific syntax might vary depending on the programming language being used."
