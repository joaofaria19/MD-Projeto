    "Prompt": "Describe the structure of an atom.",
    "Completion": "The atom consists of a nucleus, an electron shell, and a valence shell. An electron shell is the outermost shell of an atom. The electron shell encloses all of the atom's protons, neutrons, and electrons. The neutron shell contains the nuclei of all atoms, while the electron shell contains only the electrons that bind to those protons. An atom has two electron shells: an outer shell and an inner shell. The outer shell is surrounded by an electron cloud. The inner shell is filled with electrons and has a net positive charge. Electrons in the outer shell are attracted to protons in the inner shell, forming a positive electric charge. Neutrons are drawn to the outer electron shell and repelled from the inner electron shell. A proton is a positively charged ion. A neutron is an electron that combines with a proton to form a neutron. An alpha particle, also called a photon, is an electromagnetic particle that interacts with other photons to produce light and sound. A photon is any particle that vibrates at a frequency equal to or greater than the vibrational frequency of the proton or neutron it is paired with. A gamma particle is an anti-particle that does not interact with other particles and does not vibrate at frequencies lower than those of the photon. A beta particle has the same configuration as a beta particle except that it vibrates more slowly and has lower energy levels."

The doctor gives him some advice. He tells him that he should follow his heart and do what he thinks is right. Then he gives him a piece of paper with a question mark in the middle. He asks the question, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" Then the doctor says, \"Anesthesiologist.\" The protagonist takes the paper and puts it on his desk. He starts to read it. Soon he falls asleep. The next day he wakes up and reads the paper again. The question mark is still there. He continues to read the paper. Soon the question mark disappears. The protagonist gets up and walks to the bathroom. He looks in the mirror and sees that his hair is messed up. He shaves it off. He washes his face and puts toothpaste on his toothbrush. He brushes his teeth and puts mouthwash on his gums. He rinses his mouth with water and spits it out. He takes a shower and puts on deodorant. He gets dressed and goes to work. His boss is waiting for him at the office. He sits at his desk and stares at the clock. He finishes his paper and walks out the door. The boss comes in and congratulates him on his good work. He thanks him for his hard work and wishes him luck for the future. He leaves and walks down the hallway to his car. As he gets out of his car he sees his reflection in the rear view mirror. He smiles and waves to the camera."

For example, you can set the thermostat to turn itself on at 6 a.m. and turn it off at 8 p.m, or set it to turn off at 6am and on again at 8pm. Turning off the lights when you leave the room is a great way to save energy. If you live in an area that receives a lot of sunlight, consider installing skylights. Skylights are a good way to reduce the amount of light that enters your home during the day. You can find skylight kits at most home improvement stores. Installing a smart meter can help you track how much electricity you are using in your home. The meter will tell you how much energy your home uses and how much you can save by turning off lights and other appliances when you aren't using them. It can also help you save money on your energy bill by allowing you to pay for your energy use over the course of a year instead of paying for it month after month."

    "Completion": "5 * 5 = 20 cm  20 cm = 100 cm 2  2 = 50 cm 2 The total surface area of a cube with a side length of 5 cm is 20 cm2 so the cube has a total area of 50 cm2 / 5 cm2 = 10 cm2 per side. To find the total area, multiply the side lengths by the number of sides to find the area of each side: 5 x 5 = 25 cm2 for each side. Multiply the sides by the length of one side to find how many total sides there are: 25 / 4 = 3 total lengths. Then add the lengths of all three sides to get the total length: 5 + 3 = 8 cm2. Then multiply that length by the width of one of the cub's faces to find its total area: 10 * 8 = 80 cm2. Subtract 1 cm2 from both sides and multiply both sides by 2 to find their area: 8 * 2 = 16 cm2. Now add the sides of both cubes and multiply the result by the square root of 4 to find each side's area: 16 * 4 = 64 cm2 total area. Now add both sides of each cube and multiply that amount by the height of 1 cube to find it's height: 64 * 1 = 84 cm2. Finally, subtract the height from the width to find out how many cm2 of surface area there is total: 84 * 1 + 84 = 96 cm2. Therefore, the answer is 96."

Decide how many people you will be delivering to. Determine how much money you are willing to spend on food delivery. Make a list of all the ingredients you will need to make your food. Create a budget and stick to it. Choose a day and time that works best for you. Once you have decided on a date and time, call the restaurant and place your order. Once your order has been placed, you will receive a text message with a tracking number. When your food is ready, you can pick it up at the restaurant or have it delivered to your home. Be sure to include a phone number where you can be reached if you have any questions.

    "Completion": "The World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It was originally intended to be a peer-to-peer network that allowed users to send and receive data over a network of nodes called \"nodes\", each node connecting to a node on the network via a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) connection. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was formed in 1989 as a non-profit organization to promote the development of an open, standards-based, and interoperable WWW. In 1990, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was established to regulate the use of the name \"Internet\" and related domain names. In 1996, the Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (DNDRP) was implemented to resolve disputes between domain name registrants and registrars. In 1998, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) was developed to provide a globally unique identifier for each host on the Internet. In 1999, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) issued a standard for the Internet Domain Name System (DNS), which became known as the Internet Protocol (IP) in 2001. In 2003, the United States Department of Commerce (DoD) announced the creation of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to oversee the development and deployment of the NTIA. In 2005, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated the Internet as an \"extremely high-priority\" target for cyber espionage. In 2006, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) issued an Executive Order requiring the DOJ to \"immediately\" launch an investigation into the DHS's cybercrime activities."

I put the keys in the ignition and drive away. I open my car door and look out the window. I see my car in the driveway. I get out of the car and look at it. It's parked in front of my house. I walk up to the front door and open it. I take a deep breath and open the door. My car is waiting for me. I pull up to my house and look inside. My cat is curled up in a ball on the floor. I pick him up and put him in his bed. I turn on the radio and listen to the news. I read the headlines and see that a tornado is headed my way. I decide to stay put and wait for the storm to pass. As the storm passes, I look out my window and see the tree limbs swaying violently in the wind. I don't know what to do. I just sit there and watch the storm pass by. The next day, I get a call from my boss. He tells me that he's sending me home early. I tell him that I'm not going to be able to make it. He gives me an ultimatum. He says that if I can't make it today, he will send me home tomorrow. I told him that was not an option. He said he would send me a text message. I looked at my phone and saw that my text message had been sent. I hung up the phone and looked outside. I saw my cat lying on the ground. I ran over to her and gave her a big hug. I kissed her and told her that I loved her. She hugged me back and told me how much she meant to me. She told me that she was proud of me and that I should be proud of her too. I thanked her and wished her the best for the rest of her day."
